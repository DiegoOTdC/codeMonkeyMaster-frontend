## Pages
We used [Codaisseur's frontend template](https://github.com/Codaisseur/react-redux-jwt-bootstrap-template) that set up a base with a login and signup page, navbar and other things. We know how to do this from scratch, but decided we wanted to be able to spend more time on more challenging things.

## What did we learn or find challenging
[Stephanie](https://github.com/StephBerg86):   
"For me this was my first project working as a (remote) team. This is something that can be pretty challenging, but I have to say that this went really well with our team. The communication between us was very clear and everybody worked hard, so I learned that I enjoy to work in a team. 
Using Git branches was also a new thing for me. This project was perfect to experiment with that and in the end it worked out great. In this project I also took a bit more time for the styling part by trying out some small animations."

[Darian](https://github.com/DarianRushworth):

[Diégo](https://github.com/DiegoOTdC):   
"First off I want to say, the cooperation between us went really smoothly, it was really nice to work together on this project! I think everyone right away knew what they wanted to do and if we were stuck or just needed to figure out the next step, the communication was always open and great for that. If there were mistakes or things needed to change, we all handled the feedback great I think. 

What was new for me in coding, was to really **work together in a team** like this. Which was really nice. Furthermore how to **use git better** (also in a team).  Making pull requests correctly, reviewing pull requests from others, etc. I made the [Exercise Page](https://github.com/codeMonkeyMasters/codeMonkeyMaster-frontend/tree/development/src/pages/Exercise) and [QuizCode component](https://github.com/codeMonkeyMasters/codeMonkeyMaster-frontend/tree/development/src/components/QuizCode), which both had some (for me) **difficult logic**. It's always fun when it works in the end!
